Notes

# Managing processes

## The kill command

List shortcuts: stty -a

List all kill signals: kill -l

Default signal is “term” (equivalent to -15 and sigterm)


## pgrep and pkill

List all sshd process IDs: pgrep sshd

Details for processes: ps -F -p $(pgrep sshd)

Kill all sleep processes: pkill sleep

## The top command

Press the f key to configure field sorting

# Process priority

## Backgrounding tasks

bg - background task
fg - foreground task
jobs - list of tasks

Ctrl-z suspends a running process

In bash shells, a background task keeps running when the shell has exited. Systemd becomes the parent process.

## Process priorities

Display process priority and nice value: ps -l

Nice value range: -20 to +19

The higher the nice value, the lower the priority.

Start a low priority task: nice -n 19 sleep 1000 

Regular users can only use nice natures >=0

“renice” sets the priority of a running process. Can’t raise the priority as a regular user.

To change the default priority: /etc/security/limits.conf

# Monitoring performance

## Package: procps-ng

* ps, pgrep, pkill
* top
* free - display free memory

### pmap, pwdx

pmap displays a memory map for the nominated process

pwdx displays the working directory for a process. Uses /proc/<id>/cwd value

    sudo pwdx $(grep sshd)

### uptime, watch and tload

Uptime Displays server uptime and stats

/proc/uptime
/proc/loadavg

Watch provides a running display of uptime.

tload displays cpu utilisation in near-real time

### w

Fancy who with stats

### lscpu

lists the cpus on the system

### top and vmstat

Batch mode: top -b 

vmstat - stats for procs, memory, swap, cpu, io

# sysstat
