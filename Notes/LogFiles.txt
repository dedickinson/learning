# Log files

## Auditing logins

As root, use “lastlog” to list last logins. To view only users that have logged in:

    lastlog | grep -v “Never”

“last” lists the last logins. “last -n 10” to limit entries

To view reboots:

    last reboot

For a user:

    last duncan

Data is from /var/wtmp 

Bad logins:

    Sudo lastb

Data is from /var/btmp

## Auditing root access

Audits use of the su and sudo commands.

    /var/log/secure

    grep secure /var/log/secure
    grep su: /var/log/secure

The logs show the call to sudo or su but not the commands run in the su session

## Using awk to analyse logs

File: /var/log/secure

    awk ‘/sudo/ { print $0 } ‘ /var/log/secure

    awk ‘/sudo/ { print $5, $6 } ‘ /var/log/secure

Create a script (secure.sh)

    #!/usr/bin/bash
    awk “/$1/ { print \$5,\$6,\$14 } “ $2

./secure.sh sudo /var/log/secure

# Configure logging

    /etc/rsyslog.conf
    /etc/rsyslog.d

Some rules log to files, some to modules

Need to restart rsyslog after config changes

    systemctl restart rsyslog

The logger command can be used to send a log message

    logger -p local1.warn “Test message”

Check /var/log/messages but can also configure local1 messages to also go to their own file.

## Log rotate

Runs daily under cron.daily

    /etc/logrotate.conf

Can add an entry in conf or in a logrotate.d file

Can run logrotate ad-hoc

    logrotate /etc/logrotate.conf

## Journalctl

A Systemd facility.

    journalctl
    journalctl -n
    journalctl -n 20
    journalctl -f
    journalctl -u sshd.service
    journalctl —since “2016-01-21 12:00:00”
    journalctl —since “10 minutes ago”
    journalctl —list-boots
    journalctl -b -1 #for the previous boot

Entries are in memory so reset on reboot

Config:

    /etc/systemd/journals.conf

Can be set to send to a log file. Reconfig needs a reboot
